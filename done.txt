fixed up all emp related reports and forms....this took wayyyy longer than it should have...

duplicate button and form related seems to work

changed explanation and comment to text areas so you can input more text

trigger to change emp_eff_date on f15c4_emp

edited ddl4

delete page 4-form on doc

delete page 22-status history; really don't need to see them all like this
