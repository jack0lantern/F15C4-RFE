phone number formatting is...ugly
want but not need

not so much as something we need to do...as much as an excuse not to do it XD
i don't see the need for a search bar....since the provided one works fine already

blob doesn't work; seems that the input value...is an issue
v and nv both doesn't work

realized this issue....when we don't change rfe, doc and comment can't be added
...just separate buttons to add doc and comment only?

conditions for the approve and reject buttons on detailed rfe needs to be fixed

conditions for showing eff date in approve page might need to be fixed

should we keep the emp_id field or change CREATED/UPDATED with the emp_id?

fyi reviewer has yet to be done
