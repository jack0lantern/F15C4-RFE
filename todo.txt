-Make documents upload work

-"Here is a suggestion for creating an RFE View which can be used for inserting into the RFE table and another table. If you use this, you will need to remove the insert trigger on the RFE table (and from the ddl2 file) and make an Apex Form on the RFE View instead of on the RFE table."

-Make approval system work

-Instead of having flags sys_admin, lab_dir, exec_dir, etc. just have a field since a person can only be one of them, according to piazza

-Decide if comments, tracking comments, and descriptions are different things for rfe, and add columns in appropriate places

-Set RFE modification rights according to auth table OR requestor/approver/contact status

-Move all our stuff to GitHub (last thing to do)

-Make part 2 more "imaginative" (not a list of data)
